# July 9th

Created various GitHub and Discord automation

Tidied up our repository so every member can easily use it

We decided to not install pre-commit on every member's computer.
We went for a faster development speed instead

# July 10th

Almost every member did their first commit by adding their name on the readme

Lint action was acting up but nopeless found out that the error was rather a non-issue

We drafted out ideas on a shared drawing board

Our idea revolves around the game `pong` the first game ever created
